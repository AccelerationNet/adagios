# At this point, you should only install adagios if you are a tester or a developer
# It is an extremely good idea to change your /etc/nagios/ into a git repository
# So you can track any changes made to configuration files

# Installation instructions for RHEL 5.x


# Install version control utilities
yum install -y git subversion

# Install adagios from repository
cd /opt
git clone http://opensource.is/git/adagios.git

# Install pynag from repository
svn checkout http://pynag.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ pynag
echo 'export PYTHONPATH="/opt/pynag:/opt/okconfig"' > /etc/profile.d/pythonpath.sh

# Make sure new environment variables are set
source /etc/profile


# Install nagios so adagios has at least some configuration files to play with
yum install -i nagios


# Install dependencies
yum install -y python-json pip-python fping
pip-python install django


# If you run adagios as a user, make sure it can read (and possibly write) to all nagios config files, error handling is lacking in cases where it doesnt have required permissions

useradd adagios -G nagios -d /opt/adagios
chown -R adagios /opt/adagios
su - adagios
python manage.py runserver


# Now try to access http://yourhost:8000
